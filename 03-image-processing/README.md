#### 0. Get Model Weights

Before getting started, you need to copy over the model weights file, which is
`../02-model-training/custom-model.pt` or
`../02-model-training/runs/train/weights/best.pt`.

Also, copy over the `classes.txt` file from `../02-model-training/`.

Rename it `custom-model.pt` if you haven't already.

#### 1. Run the Measurement Script!

```
python 01_measure-windows.py
```
